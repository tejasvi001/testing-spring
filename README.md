## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 11 or higher
- Maven or Gradle

### Build and Run

```bash
# Using Maven
mvn clean install

# Using Gradle
./gradlew build
```

### Run All Tests

```bash
# Maven
mvn test

# Gradle
./gradlew test
```

## Running Unit and Integration Tests Separately

Make sure your test classes follow naming conventions:
- Unit tests: `*Test.java`
- Integration tests: `*IT.java` or under a separate package

To run only unit tests (Maven):
```bash
mvn -Dtest='*Test' test
```
To run only integration tests:
```bash
mvn -Dtest='*IT' test
```

## Jacoco Test Coverage Report

Run the following to generate the JaCoCo coverage report:

### Maven

```bash
mvn clean test jacoco:report
```

The report will be generated at:
```
target/site/jacoco/index.html
```

### Gradle

```bash
./gradlew jacocoTestReport
```

The report will be generated at:
```
build/reports/jacoco/test/html/index.html
```
